## Java Servlet Example

This project contains examples on how to use Java Servlets. The repository is broken up into different branches - each branch demonstrates a different feature.

The project also contains configuration files for both Maven and Gradle, so you can use whichever build tool you'd prefer.

All of the branches are configured to be run in an embedded Jetty Server. In Maven, you can launch it by running 'mvn jetty:run', and in Gradle by running 'gradle appRun'. The server will launch on `localhost:8080`.
