## Servlet Filter Tutorial

This project contains examples on how to use Servlet Filters.

The project can be built with either Maven or Gradle, so you can use whichever build tool you'd prefer.

The code is configured to be run in an embedded Jetty Server. In Maven, you can launch it by running 'mvn jetty:run', and in Gradle by running 'gradle appRun'. The server will launch on `localhost:8080`.
